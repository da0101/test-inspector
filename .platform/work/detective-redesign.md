# detective-redesign

> **One-line goal:** strip Test Inspector down to a detective that tells the senior developer, in plain English, what works / what doesn't / what to fix — and delete everything else.

## Scope

- **In:** audit current implementation (dashboard, investigator pipeline, signal services, command surface); design a minimal detective UI; rewrite the investigator to produce a narrative ("X is risky BECAUSE …; the existing tests only prove Y; ADD test Z") instead of metric dumps; cut dead commands / tree views / vanity KPIs.
- **In:** keep the deterministic core smart enough on its own; LLM is a bonus accelerator, not the brain.
- **In:** the product thesis lens — every kept signal must help catch fake / flaky / LLM-generated / junior-written bad tests.
- **Out:** new framework adapters (Vue, Swift, C++ — see decisions.md deferred #2).
- **Out:** marketplace publish prep (separate stream).
- **Out:** any change to coverage-file format support (LCOV, coverage.py XML/JSON stay; Istanbul JSON deferred).

## Done criteria

- [ ] Audit complete and approved by Danil (this stream file's `## 🔍 Audit Report` section is filled and reviewed)
- [ ] Redesign proposal approved by Danil (in chat — no `.md` artifact)
- [ ] `src/views/dashboard.ts` split below 300 lines per file
- [ ] `src/extension.ts` split below 300 lines per file
- [ ] Investigator pipeline produces a single coherent "case file" narrative per source/feature, not 7 independent panels
- [ ] At least 8 commands and at least 2 tree views removed (placeholder targets — final count from audit)
- [ ] Unit tests cover the new investigator synthesis (golden master in `test/fixtures/`)
- [ ] Manual QA on a real React + Flutter monorepo verifies the new UI reads as "a paragraph, not a wall of cards"
- [ ] `.platform/memory/log.md` appended
- [ ] `decisions.md` updated — at least one product decision row for the detective framing
- [ ] `domains/dashboard.md`, `domains/investigation.md`, `domains/quality.md` updated to match new contract
- [ ] `STATUS.md` updated — old surfaces removed, new ones added

## Key decisions

_Append-only. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — <decision> — <rationale>`_

- 2026-05-16 — Audit first, propose second, code third — Danil reframed product before any implementation; we need to know what to delete before we design the replacement.

## Worktree / Local environment

| Repo | Worktree path | Branch | Base | Dependencies | Local command | Localhost port(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| test-inspector | _TODO — set during stage 1c, before implementation_ | `feature/detective-redesign` | _TODO — `develop` doesn't exist yet; confirm with user whether to branch from `main` or create `develop` first_ | _TODO — `npm ci` after worktree create_ | `npm run watch` (extension dev) · F5 (Extension Development Host) | n/a (VS Code extension; no http server) |

## Resume state
_Overwritten by `ab checkpoint` — the compact payload the next agent reads first. Keep this block under ~10 lines._

## Progress log

2026-05-16 13:49 — (auto) 75c0456: v0.0.2: bump version + lock in per-fix bump convention

2026-05-16 13:27 — (auto) ad48454: Phase C-1: per-project grouping in the Cases sidebar

2026-05-16 13:17 — (auto) 6d1179c: Phase C-0: auto-scan on first activation + clearer empty state

2026-05-16 12:22 — (auto) 7c55a7f: Phase B-2: source-file MISSING verdicts + populated Cases tree + install script

2026-05-16 12:17 — (auto) 8f9e12b: Phase B-1: real verdicts via 3 LLM-pattern detectors + synthesis pipeline

2026-05-16 11:55 — (auto) 7df1328: Phase A.5: cut legacy UI; slim extension entry

- 2026-05-16 — Phase B-1 landed: 3 LLM-pattern detectors (vague-title, mock-only-assertions, mocks-unit-under-test); real synthesis (THEATER ≥60 weight / WEAK 1–59 / STRONG 0); narrative + suggestion generators; refresh pipeline wires detect → discover → analyzeQuality → synthesize across ALL projects. Calibrated against survey of `/Users/danilulmashev/Documents/GitHub/Ai-Interior-Design` (Flutter + Firebase Functions). Tests 29/29 (was 18/18 after Phase A.5), compile clean. Pending commit approval.

- 2026-05-16 — Phase A.5 cuts: deleted 9 legacy views + 3 investigator services; rewrote extension.ts (~900 → 50 lines) and package.json contributes (24 commands → 5, 5 tree views → 1); added empty Cases tree provider so viewsWelcome surfaces. Tests 18/18, compile clean. Pending commit approval.

2026-05-16 11:38 — (auto) 5e29340: Pre-detective-redesign baseline

- 2026-05-16 — Phase A scaffold landed: caseFile types + stub synthesis + stub Webview panel + 4 passing unit tests. Compile + tests green at 18/18.
- 2026-05-16 — Decisions D#12 (info-layer only) and D#13 (LLM as ambient co-worker) locked in `.platform/memory/decisions.md`.
- 2026-05-16 — Branches: `develop` created from `main`; `feature/detective-redesign` created from `develop`. Worktree skipped per user.
- 2026-05-16 — Audit synthesized (4 parallel Explore agents) and pasted into `## 🔍 Audit Report` below.
- 2026-05-16 — Stream created from `detective-redesign` reframe. Audit dispatched: dashboard surface, detective pipeline, signal quality, command + entry surface.

## Open questions

_None at the moment. Three resolved 2026-05-16: branch base → `develop` from `main`, then `feature/detective-redesign` from `develop`; cut depth → hard cut (Phase A.5 executed); "explain like 5yo" → one narrative with signals exposed via "Show evidence" button (D#13 / case-file template)._

## 🔍 Audit Report

> **Required:** After every audit request, paste the full standardized report here.
> Do NOT leave the audit only in chat — it must be anchored here so the next session has it.
> Format: `.platform/workflow.md` → Stream / Feature Analysis Protocol → Step 4 template.
> After a clean re-audit (all 🟢), remove this section before stream closure.

# 📋 detective-redesign — Audit Snapshot

> **Stream:** `detective-redesign` · **Date:** 2026-05-16 · **Status:** 🟡 drifted from product thesis
> **Repos touched:** `test-inspector` (single repo)
> **Run via:** Stream / Feature Analysis Protocol — 4 parallel Explore agents (dashboard surface · detective pipeline · signal quality · command + entry).

## ⚡ At-a-Glance Scorecard

| | 🖥️ test-inspector |
|---|:---:|
| **Implementation** | 🟡 |
| **Tests** | 🔴 |
| **Security** | 🟢 |
| **Code Quality** | 🔴 |
| **Product alignment (vs ROADMAP "Definition of Actually Useful")** | 🔴 |

> **Bottom line:** The scaffolding (adapters, signals, parsers, webview) is in place and safely built. The load-bearing **synthesis layer** that turns signals into "BookingFlow.tsx is bullshit because X, Y, Z — delete this test, write this one instead" does not exist. Today the tool reports facts; the product needs to issue **verdicts**.

---

## 🔄 How the product *should* work (vs how it works today)

```
SHOULD: signals → SYNTHESIS → 1 paragraph verdict per file ("delete X, write Y, why")
                    ▲
                  (missing)

TODAY:  signals → 7 independent panels → user mentally synthesizes → gives up
```

---

## 🛡️ Security

| Severity | Finding |
|:---:|---|
| 🟢 Clean | All subprocess use `execFile` with arg arrays (services/runner.ts). No `exec`/`shell:true`/`execSync`. |
| 🟢 Clean | LLM key in VS Code SecretStorage only (services/llm.ts). |
| 🟡 Medium | Webview CSP / HTML-escape helper not yet audited end-to-end for the dashboard (38 KB file). Re-verify after redesign. |
| 🟡 Medium | `testInspector.llm.baseUrl` lacks https validation today (settings accept any URL). |

## 🔧 Open issues

### 🔴 Must Fix (blocking the product thesis)

| # | Issue | Location | Why this blocks the thesis |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Investigator outputs a list-dump, not the BookingFlow paragraph | src/services/investigator.ts:22-24, 77-136 | Without synthesis there is no detective |
| 2 | Missing "mocks the unit under test" detector | src/services/quality.ts:149-153 | Single most diagnostic LLM-fake-test pattern |
| 3 | Missing "mock-assertions-only" detector | src/services/quality.ts | Distinguishes `expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled()` from real assertion |
| 4 | Missing "vague test title" detector | src/services/quality.ts | LLM-generated titles are uniformly vague |
| 5 | No "DELETE THIS TEST" verdict in any output | investigator.ts + quality.ts | User explicitly wants this — verdicts not facts |
| 6 | Dashboard has ~28 surfaces; ~60% are noise | src/views/dashboard.ts | Buries the signal |
| 7 | 4 of 5 sidebar tree views duplicate the dashboard | src/views/{projects,tests,coverage,changedFiles}View.ts | Three places for the same thing |
| 8 | `src/extension.ts` and `src/views/dashboard.ts` violate the 300-line cap | extension.ts · dashboard.ts | Blocks adding new code under any rule |
| 9 | No unit tests for the heuristics that ARE the product | quality · sourceRisk · investigator · git · llm | Every product-thesis bet currently untestable |

### 🟡 Should Fix Soon

| # | Issue | Location |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | Criticality signals are keyword regex with high false-positive rate | sourceRisk.ts:207-240 |
| 11 | Coverage weighted heavily despite high coverage ≠ good tests | sourceRisk.ts:266-269 |
| 12 | Source-to-test mapping basename-only — no TS alias / barrel / Python / Dart resolution | git.ts:75-95 (Phase 3) |
| 13 | Feature grouping is folder-name guesswork; misses utilities/cross-cutting | features.ts:67-102 |
| 14 | Coverage bar color logic is inverted-psychology | dashboard.ts:1042-1053 |
| 15 | `onView:*` activation events wake the extension on sidebar reveal | package.json:14-21 |
| 16 | `testInspector.llm.baseUrl` accepts any URL — no https validation | services/llm.ts |
| 17 | Investigation Markdown export is a flat enumeration, not a narrative | investigationReport.ts:4-40 |

### ⚪ Known limitations (document, don't block)

| # | Limitation |
|---|---|
| 18 | Vue.js adapter absent (decisions deferred #2) |
| 19 | Istanbul JSON / Vitest / Flutter URI path normalization deferred (Phase 5) |
| 20 | No persistence / trend history (Phase 11) |
| 21 | No bundler — Marketplace cold-start slow (decisions deferred #1) |
