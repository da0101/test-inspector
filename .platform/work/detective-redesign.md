# detective-redesign

> **One-line goal:** strip Test Inspector down to a detective that tells the senior developer, in plain English, what works / what doesn't / what to fix — and delete everything else.

## Scope

- **In:** audit current implementation (dashboard, investigator pipeline, signal services, command surface); design a minimal detective UI; rewrite the investigator to produce a narrative ("X is risky BECAUSE …; the existing tests only prove Y; ADD test Z") instead of metric dumps; cut dead commands / tree views / vanity KPIs.
- **In:** keep the deterministic core smart enough on its own; LLM is a bonus accelerator, not the brain.
- **In:** the product thesis lens — every kept signal must help catch fake / flaky / LLM-generated / junior-written bad tests.
- **Out:** new framework adapters (Vue, Swift, C++ — see decisions.md deferred #2).
- **Out:** marketplace publish prep (separate stream).
- **Out:** any change to coverage-file format support (LCOV, coverage.py XML/JSON stay; Istanbul JSON deferred).

## Done criteria

- [ ] Audit complete and approved by Danil (this stream file's `## 🔍 Audit Report` section is filled and reviewed)
- [ ] Redesign proposal approved by Danil (in chat — no `.md` artifact)
- [ ] `src/views/dashboard.ts` split below 300 lines per file
- [ ] `src/extension.ts` split below 300 lines per file
- [ ] Investigator pipeline produces a single coherent "case file" narrative per source/feature, not 7 independent panels
- [ ] At least 8 commands and at least 2 tree views removed (placeholder targets — final count from audit)
- [ ] Unit tests cover the new investigator synthesis (golden master in `test/fixtures/`)
- [ ] Manual QA on a real React + Flutter monorepo verifies the new UI reads as "a paragraph, not a wall of cards"
- [ ] `.platform/memory/log.md` appended
- [ ] `decisions.md` updated — at least one product decision row for the detective framing
- [ ] `domains/dashboard.md`, `domains/investigation.md`, `domains/quality.md` updated to match new contract
- [ ] `STATUS.md` updated — old surfaces removed, new ones added

## Key decisions

_Append-only. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — <decision> — <rationale>`_

- 2026-05-16 — Audit first, propose second, code third — Danil reframed product before any implementation; we need to know what to delete before we design the replacement.

## Worktree / Local environment

| Repo | Worktree path | Branch | Base | Dependencies | Local command | Localhost port(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| test-inspector | _TODO — set during stage 1c, before implementation_ | `feature/detective-redesign` | _TODO — `develop` doesn't exist yet; confirm with user whether to branch from `main` or create `develop` first_ | _TODO — `npm ci` after worktree create_ | `npm run watch` (extension dev) · F5 (Extension Development Host) | n/a (VS Code extension; no http server) |

## Resume state
_Overwritten by `ab checkpoint` — the compact payload the next agent reads first. Keep this block under ~10 lines._

- **Last updated:** 2026-05-16 by claude-code
- **What just happened:** Shipped v0.0.8 → v0.0.19 (uncommitted): Phase D LLM provider abstraction (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini) with anti-hallucination prompt + line-anchor verification + truncation-tolerant JSON; sidebar AI Reviewer webview replacing QuickPick; scroll + filter state persistence; per-card spinner UI; install.sh hardened with `rm -rf out` to kill stale-cache bugs. End-to-end verified by Danil on Ai-Interior-Design (Theater + Weak cards reviewed by Gemini with real line-anchored citations).
- **Current focus:** Pre-release audit — 47/47 tests green. Dispatching 2 parallel agents (implementation + security + code quality; test-coverage gaps). After agents return, fill the top test gaps then await Danil's explicit go on the release commit.
- **Next action:** Wait for audit agents, paste standardized scorecard into `## 🔍 Audit Report` below, add the highest-priority tests the audit surfaces, then propose the release commit (single big commit covering v0.0.8 → v0.0.19, or split per phase — Danil decides).
- **Blockers:** none.

## Progress log

2026-05-16 18:45 — v0.0.19 (uncommitted): Sidebar AI Reviewer webview replaces QuickPick — provider/model/key form inline in activity-bar container. Key field never sent back to webview; multiple provider keys storable simultaneously; per-provider Test button shows ok/error inline. New: `src/views/reviewer/{template,panel}.ts`. Tests 47/47.

2026-05-16 18:34 — v0.0.18 (uncommitted): Filter state persisted across re-renders via `vscode.setState`. Fixes "AI review on Weak card bounces to Theater" UX bug. Tests 47/47.

2026-05-16 18:27 — v0.0.17 (uncommitted): scrollY persisted across re-renders. Fixes scroll-to-top jump on AI review / Mark Reviewed / Rescan. Tests 47/47.

2026-05-16 18:26 — v0.0.16 (uncommitted): Inline spinner on aiReview + rescan buttons (CSS-only ring, prefers-reduced-motion). Tests 47/47.

2026-05-16 18:14 — v0.0.15 (uncommitted): 6000-token Gemini budget + truncation-tolerant JSON validator. Extracts prose explanation via regex when JSON is truncated; labels via `uncertaintyNotes`. Tests 47/47.

2026-05-16 18:01 — v0.0.14 (uncommitted): validateExplanation now hunts the largest `{...}` substring (catches prose-wrapped Gemini responses); raw response logged on enrichment failure for debugging. Tests 47/47.

2026-05-16 17:58 — v0.0.13 (uncommitted): `scripts/install.sh` now `rm -rf out` before tsc — root cause of every stale-cache "createProviderRegistry is not a function" was tsc not removing `out/src/services/llm.js` after `src/services/llm.ts` was deleted in favour of the `llm/` folder. Tests 47/47.

2026-05-16 17:27 — v0.0.12 (uncommitted): defensive try/catch around `createProviderRegistry` call in activate(); diagnostic logs at every activation step. Tests 47/47.

2026-05-16 17:25 — v0.0.8 → v0.0.11 (uncommitted): Phase D-1 LLM provider abstraction. New `src/services/llm/` folder with `types.ts`, `http.ts`, `openai.ts`, `claude.ts`, `gemini.ts`, `registry.ts`, `enrich.ts`, `index.ts`. Strict-JSON anti-hallucination prompt; line-anchor verification drops fabricated citations; per-card "Ask AI reviewer" button surfaces verified explanation + suggested fix. Per-provider key storage in VS Code SecretStorage. 7 new tests in `llm-enrich.test.ts`. Tests 47/47.

2026-05-16 16:38 — (auto) 08b61d0: v0.0.7: calibration — Flutter detection unblocked + criticality cleanup

2026-05-16 16:04 — (auto) 35bca48: v0.0.6: daily-driver loop closed — Show Evidence, Mark Reviewed, Rescan, Markdown export

2026-05-16 15:29 — (auto) 2d38729: v0.0.5: project tabs + reactive KPI totals + scroll perf

2026-05-16 14:52 — (auto) 92f98bf: v0.0.4: dashboard redesign driven by ui-ux-pro-max recommendations

2026-05-16 14:32 — (auto) 7bf181c: v0.0.3: Case File dashboard polish — filter pills, relative paths, accent borders

2026-05-16 13:49 — (auto) 75c0456: v0.0.2: bump version + lock in per-fix bump convention

2026-05-16 13:27 — (auto) ad48454: Phase C-1: per-project grouping in the Cases sidebar

2026-05-16 13:17 — (auto) 6d1179c: Phase C-0: auto-scan on first activation + clearer empty state

2026-05-16 12:22 — (auto) 7c55a7f: Phase B-2: source-file MISSING verdicts + populated Cases tree + install script

2026-05-16 12:17 — (auto) 8f9e12b: Phase B-1: real verdicts via 3 LLM-pattern detectors + synthesis pipeline

## Open questions

_None at the moment. Three resolved 2026-05-16: branch base → `develop` from `main`, then `feature/detective-redesign` from `develop`; cut depth → hard cut (Phase A.5 executed); "explain like 5yo" → one narrative with signals exposed via "Show evidence" button (D#13 / case-file template)._

## ⚡ At-a-Glance Scorecard

| | 🖥️ test-inspector |
|---|:---:|
| **Implementation** | 🟢 |
| **Tests** | 🟢 59/59 (was 47/47 — added 12 Tier-1 LLM tests this run) |
| **Security** | 🟢 |
| **Code Quality** | 🟡 (one oversized file: views/caseFile/template.ts @ 999 lines — non-blocking) |
| **Product alignment (vs ROADMAP "Definition of Actually Useful")** | 🟢 |

> **Bottom line:** End-to-end shipped and verified by Danil on Ai-Interior-Design (Theater + Weak cards both producing real, line-anchored Gemini reviews). All Tier-1 gaps closed in this audit run. Ready for release commit after Danil's explicit go.

## 🛡️ Security

| Severity | Finding |
|:---:|---|
| 🟢 Clean | Subprocess use — `execFile`/`spawn` with arg arrays only. No `exec`/`shell:true`/`execSync`. OutputChannel logs argv as a list, not a reconstructed shell string. |
| 🟢 Clean | LLM API keys in `vscode.SecretStorage` only. Read on demand inside `provider.complete()` (openai.ts:32 / claude.ts:36 / gemini.ts:36). Never logged, never sent to webview, never exported in Markdown. |
| 🟢 Clean | LLM base URL validation — http.ts:24-25 rejects non-https URLs except localhost/127.0.0.1. |
| 🟢 Clean | Webview CSP / HTML escape — every interpolated value goes through `escapeHtml` (template.ts:5-14). Reviewer panel applies the same. |
| 🟡 Medium | Workspace trust not explicitly guarded in `scanWorkspace()` (extension.ts:177). Current scan is read-only so risk is low, but add a guard before test execution lands. |
| 🟡 Medium | `ReviewedStore.load()` silently swallows JSON parse errors (reviewed.ts:29-31). Acceptable fallback, but corruption is invisible. |

## 🔧 Open issues

### 🔴 Must Fix (blocking release)

_None remaining. The Tier-1 LLM provider test gap was closed in this audit run (12 new tests added)._

### 🟡 Should Fix Soon (post-release ok)

| # | Issue | Location |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `src/views/caseFile/template.ts` at **999 lines** — over 300-line cap. Should split into template-kpis / template-cases / template-filters / template-review. Functional but maintenance debt. | src/views/caseFile/template.ts |
| 2 | classifySourceFile MISSING/WEAK boundary tests at 4% / 49% / 50% coverage | src/services/caseFile.ts:139-223 |
| 3 | createProviderRegistry + activeProvider untested | src/services/llm/registry.ts |
| 4 | Workspace trust not guarded in scanWorkspace | src/extension.ts:177 |
| 5 | ReviewedStore.load() silently swallows JSON parse errors | src/services/reviewed.ts:29-31 |
| 6 | `reviewed.load()` fire-and-forget — load failure leaves cards un-hidden silently | src/extension.ts:50 |
| 7 | ReviewerViewProvider message handlers untested (VS Code WebviewViewProvider mocking is non-trivial) | src/views/reviewer/panel.ts |

### ⚪ Known limitations (document, don't block)

| # | Limitation |
|---|---|
| 8 | Vue.js adapter absent (decisions deferred #2) |
| 9 | Istanbul JSON / Vitest / Flutter URI normalization deferred (Phase 5) |
| 10 | No persistence / trend history beyond reviewed-state (Phase 11) |
| 11 | No bundler — Marketplace cold-start slow (decisions deferred #1) |
